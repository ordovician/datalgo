# DatAlgo
DatAlgo is a loose assortment of data structures and algorithms written in Go. These are mainly for demonstration
and educational purposes.

This will be stuff like find, sort, map and filter functions. Data structures like linked lists, binaries trees
and so on. I am using this as a grab bag for data structure and algorithms.
